# BestiaryInC-
Decided I should be doing some non-Unity programming as well. I'm going to create that bestiary I mentioned in another project of mine. Did this just to test out switch cases in C# (I've only done them in C++). In my venture to learn C# in such a way that I can say without a doubt that I know the language, switch cases are something that I should know, so there. Updates to come, barebones in V1.
